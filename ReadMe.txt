This code implements a 2D modifyed magneto-frictional system in Firedrake which provides non-force-free 
equilibria of the system.

This uses concepts from the paper "Helicity- preserving finite element discretization 
for magnetic relaxation" by Mingdong He, Patrick E. Farrell, Kaibo Hu, and Boris D. Andrew, 2025.
