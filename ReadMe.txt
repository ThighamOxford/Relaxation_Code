This code implements a 2D modified magneto-frictional system in Firedrake which provides non-force-free 
equilibria of the system.

This uses concepts from the paper "Helicity-preserving finite element discretization for magnetic
relaxation" by Mingdong He, Patrick E. Farrell, Kaibo Hu, and Boris D. Andrews, 2025.
